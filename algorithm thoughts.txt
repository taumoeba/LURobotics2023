Just some pseudo-code representing the main algorithm for the robot

Field layout:
-----------------------------------------------------------
| food  |                                     | recycling |
|corner2|                   ***               |           |
|--------                 *******             |-----------|
|                           ***                           |

const int endSweepTime = 150; //seconds
const int pathFollowDistance = 10; //cm

// Setup
initialize components
verify sensors are returning valid data
check distance to walls
wait for activation signal
activate dummy bot
wait a couple seconds so dummy bot is free

drive to food corner 1 (bottom left)
drop matching chips
drive to food corner 2 (top left)
drop matching chips

// Begin sweeping pattern
while(elapsedTime <= endSweepTime)
{
	moveToWaypoint
	look for objects
	if object found:
		identify object
		identify distance and angle
		move to intercept position
		confirm object identity
		identify orientation
		grab object using position and orientation data
		if object is pedestal:
			decide which stack to add to
			rotate turntable to selected stack
			place pedestal in turntable
		else:
			place duck in duck storage
		return arm to neutral position
		return to path
	else:
		if completed stack exists:
			if reached open pedestal destination:
				if time allows:
					maneuver to stack-dropping position
					drop stack
					return to path
				else:
					drop stack outside of path but nearby
					return to path
}
move to recycling area (ignoring path)
orient so duck storage is facing wall
dump ducks
if still holding pedestals:
	orient turntable above recycling area
	drop pedestals
