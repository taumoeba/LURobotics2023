//Both motors drive forward pi(d)/l1 rotations
    //d is wheel diameter, l1 is distance travelled to reach right edge
//Left motor rotate backward, right motor rotate forward until rotated 90 degrees Left
//both motors rotate forward pi(d)/l2 rotations
    //l2 is distance needed to reach middle of right edge
//Wait until (last second)
    //estimate: 175 seconds from start
