//Both motors drive forward until sensors trigger (wall near)
//Left motor rotate backward, right motor rotate forward until rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise
//both motors rotate forward pi(d)/l2 rotations
    //d is wheel diameter, l2 is distance needed to reach middle of right edge
//Wait until (last second)
