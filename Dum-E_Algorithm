//Initialize systems
    //establish variables
    //check that everything's working
//Wait to be put down
//Both motors drive forward until sensors trigger (wall near)
//Left motor rotate backward, right motor rotate forward until rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise
//both motors rotate forward pi(d)/l rotations
    //d is wheel diameter, l is distance needed to reach middle of right edge
//Left motor rotate forward, right motor rotate backward until rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise
//both motors rotate backward x distance
//Wait until (last second)
    //estimate: 175 seconds from start
//activate arm
    //charge; both motors rotate forward at max speed
